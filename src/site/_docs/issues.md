Citrus provides several communication channels for getting support and submitting issues, bugs and discussions. First of 
all you can use our development mailing list [dev@citrusframework.org](mailto:dev@citrusframework.org) in order to get assistance.

If you have found a bug in Citrus, please open a new issue at [Github](https://github.com/citrus/issues). We listen very carefully 
for bugs and work hard on the issues you presented to us.

Of course we would also be happy for any help you can give us and we encourage you to contribute your changes. In case 
you have fixed a bug please see how to [contribute](${site.path}/docs/contributing) code changes and patches.
