      <h1 class="page-header">Apache Ant tasks <small>Execute Citrus with Apache Ant</small></h1>

      <p>
        You can execute Citrus tests with Apache Ant. The Citrus Ant tasks simplify the test execution
        so you just include predefined tasks into your project Ant build file.
      </p>

      <p>Note: We discontinue to provide Citrus Ant tasks from version 2.0 onwards. This is because you can easily use the usual
      JUnit or TestNG Ant tasks for Citrus test execution. However if you want to use the Citrus Ant tasks feel free to fallback
      to the latest stable version provided.</p>
      
      <p><b>Latest stable release</b>: 2.0</p>
      <ul>
        <li>citrus-ant-tasks-2.0.jar (<a href="dist/citrus-ant-tasks-2.0.jar">download</a>)</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>citrus-ant-tasks-1.4.1.jar (<a href="dist/citrus-ant-tasks-1.4.1.jar">download</a>)</li>
        <li>citrus-ant-tasks-1.4.jar (<a href="dist/citrus-ant-tasks-1.4.jar">download</a>)</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        The Apache Ant tasks can execute Citrus test cases in several modes. You can either run one single
        test by its name or all tests in a test package. In addition to that you can also use TestNG XML 
        test suite files to execute your tests.
      </p>
      
      <p>Here is a simple usage example:</p>
      
      <pre class="prettyprint linenums">&lt;typedef resource=&quot;citrustasks&quot; classpath=&quot;lib/citrus-ant-tasks-2.0.jar&quot;/&gt;

&lt;target name=&quot;citrus.run.tests&quot; description=&quot;Runs all Citrus tests&quot;&gt;
    &lt;citrus package=&quot;com.consol.citrus.*&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/target&gt;</pre>
      
      <p>
        Following parameters are supported in the <i>citrus</i> tasks
        definition.
      </p>
      
      <table class="table table-striped table-bordered">
        <tr>
          <td align="center">suitename</td>
          <td align="left">The name of the test suite to execute (List of suites is also supported, separated by space</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td align="center">test</td>
          <td align="left">List of test names that should be executed (space separated list of test names)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td align="center">package</td>
          <td align="left">List of test packages to execute. all test files in these packages are executed in this test run</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td align="center">testngXml</td>
          <td align="left">TestNG XML execution file describing the tests/test suites to execute</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      
      <p>
        In the Citrus samples section you can find several 'build.xml' scripts, which give examples how to use the Citrus ANT tasks 
        in order to run tests. You can also see how single test execution is extended with ANT prompts, so the user is asked for 
        test name inputs during execution.
      </p>
      
      <p>Please be aware of Java classpath settings in your Ant build file. Citrus is executed via Java runtime and therefore with
      Java task execution in Ant. The Citrus Ant tasks require a classpath setting and a default folder structure within your Ant
      project. So customization is limited to a certain level.</p>
      
      <p>In case you want to have more customization opportunities you can also use the pure Ant Java tasks for TestNG and JUnit
      in order to execute the Citrus test cases. The Citrus test case Java class is nothing but a normal TestNG or JUnit executable. In
      cas you are familiar with Ant you may want to use this option because you then have full power of customizing your build.</p>
