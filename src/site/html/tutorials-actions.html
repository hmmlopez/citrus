      <p>
        Citrus comes with a powerful set of actions built-in, covering a wide
        range of helpful SOA integration testing aspects like sending and
        receiving messages, database access, Java and Groovy scripting support
        or dealing with exceptions. For a full list of provided standard
        actions see the reference <a href="documentation.html">documentation</a>
        on the citrus homepage. But each project and especially each
        system-under-test (SUT) comes along with its own specifics and
        characteristics, so chances are high that during a project the need for
        an extension of the built-in citrus actions will arise. This tutorial
        shall show you how easy and handsome it is to provide your own custom
        actions and reuse them inside your citrus integration tests.
      </p>
      
      <p>Let's quickly refresh our memory how citrus actions are used in a test case:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint linenums">&lt;actions&gt;
  &lt;echo&gt;
    &lt;message&gt;Starting integration test&lt;/message&gt;
  &lt;/echo&gt;
  
  &lt;sql datasource=&quot;someDataSource&quot;&gt;
    &lt;statement&gt;DELETE FROM CUSTOMERS&lt;/statement&gt;
  &lt;/sql&gt;
  
  &lt;send endpoint=&quot;customerEndpoint&quot;&gt;
    &lt;message&gt;
      &lt;data&gt;
        &lt;![CDATA[
          &lt;RequestMessage&gt;
                 ...
          &lt;/RequestMessage&gt;
        ]]&gt;
      &lt;/data&gt;
    &lt;/message&gt;
  &lt;/send&gt;
&lt;/actions&gt;</pre>

      <p>
        As you'll notice (or already know) actions are written in a
        DSL-like syntax. But under the hood they end up as Spring beans - so
        using standard Spring mechanisms for extending citrus with your own
        custom actions will work like a charm. Let's explore a first simple way
        to introduce a custom action into your testing project.
      </p>

      <h2>Using the generic <i>action</i> element</h2>
      <p>
        This approach is almost a no-brainer, but offers less
        flexibility as we will see later on. Let's imagine a simplicistic
        scenario: your SUT outputs a lot of file traffic during the tests, so
        that we need a simple way to clean up the mess in a specific directory
        right after a test run. We also put away the fact that this could be
        as well realized by using groovy or Java actions and decide to use a
        custom action instead.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The first step is to create our own action class which extends
        com.consol.citrus.actions.AbstractTestAction:
      </p>
      
      <pre class="prettyprint linenums">public class SimpleCleanupDirAction extends AbstractTestAction {

    private String directory;

    @Override
    public void doExecute(TestContext context) {
        File dir = new File(directory);
        deleteDirectory(dir);
    }

    //ommitted directory getter/setter and deleteDirectory() method
}</pre>

      <p>
        If you want to avoid inheritance here you could as well
        implement the interface com.consol.citrus.TestAction instead. The
        property directory is declared as field with appropriate getters and
        setters so that a value can be injected by the container.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Having your test action class ready, change to citrus-config.xml
        and make it available as Spring bean there:
      </p>

      <pre class="prettyprint linenums">&lt;!-- Custom action bean --&gt;
&lt;bean name=&quot;simpleCleanupDirAction&quot; class=&quot;com.consol.jza.citrus.tutorial.actions.SimpleCleanupDirAction&quot;&gt;
  &lt;property name=&quot;directory&quot; value=&quot;/Users/jza/tmp/test&quot;/&gt;    
&lt;/bean&gt;</pre>

      <p>
        Note that the directory value is injected here during
        declaration of the bean, a drawback we will address in a second. So
        for now, your first custom action is ready to be used in citrus tests
        using the generic action element provided by citrus:
      </p>

      <pre class="prettyprint linenums">&lt;actions&gt;
  &lt;echo&gt;
      &lt;message&gt;Attention! Calling my first custom action bean!!&lt;/message&gt;
  &lt;/echo&gt;
  &lt;action reference=&quot;simpleCleanupDirAction&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/actions&gt;</pre>

      <p>
        Run your test project and enjoy your first custom action being
        executed. Easy so far, but as stated earlier, our custom action lacks
        some kind of configurability. If your SUT spammed 10 directories with
        files, you would have to declare one bean for each directory, not an
        optimal solution. So let's head on for a more generic approach using
        Spring's extensible XML authoring feature.
      </p>

      <h2>Using Spring's schema-based extensions</h2>
      <p>
        Since version 2.0, Spring provides a mechanism to define your
        own bean definition schemas and wire them into the Spring container.
        We will use this mechanism to define our own custom action schema,
        describing XML action elements which can then be used in citrus tests.
        It is much easier than it sounds, so let's get started. The
        functionality of our action bean stays the same, so just copy it and
        name it GenericCleanupDirAction inside the same package. Our aim is to
        be able to define actions in our tests like this:
      </p>

      <pre class="prettyprint linenums">&lt;actions&gt;
  &lt;custom:genericCleanupDirAction directory=&quot;/Users/jza/tmp/andSoOn&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/actions&gt;</pre>

      <p>
        To achieve this, we define our custom namespace
        (http://www.citrusframework.org/schema/jza/custom/actions) together
        with an XSD schema for our action declaration:
      </p>

      <pre class="prettyprint linenums">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;xs:schema xmlns=&quot;http://www.citrusframework.org/schema/jza/custom/actions&quot; 
  xmlns:xs=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot;
  xmlns:beans=&quot;http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans&quot;
  targetNamespace=&quot;http://www.citrusframework.org/schema/jza/custom/actions&quot;
  elementFormDefault=&quot;qualified&quot;
  attributeFormDefault=&quot;unqualified&quot;&gt;

  &lt;xs:import namespace=&quot;http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans&quot;/&gt;

  &lt;xs:element name=&quot;cleanupFileDirAction&quot;&gt;
    &lt;xs:complexType&gt;
      &lt;xs:complexContent&gt;
        &lt;xs:extension base=&quot;beans:identifiedType&quot;&gt;
          &lt;xs:attribute name=&quot;directory&quot; type=&quot;xs:string&quot; use=&quot;required&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/xs:extension&gt;
      &lt;/xs:complexContent&gt;  
    &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;
  &lt;/xs:element&gt;
&lt;/xs:schema&gt;</pre>

      <p>
        Important aspects are the declaration of the namespace we are
        using and the usage of Spring's beans namespace for the XSD extension
        mechanism to add an id attribute to our action element (as an
        alternative, we could simply add it ourselves). Place the XSD into a
        package of your source tree (I used com.consol.jza.citrus.tutorial.schema 
        in this example) and head on.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Next, we have to write two simple classes to tell Spring how to handle
        the bean definitions of our newly created namespace. At first, we have
        to provide a NamespaceHandler for our new namespace, registering a
        BeanDefinitionParser for our XML element:
      </p>

      <pre class="prettyprint linenums">public class CustomActionsNamespaceHandler extends NamespaceHandlerSupport {
        
    public void init() {
        registerBeanDefinitionParser(&quot;cleanupFileDirAction&quot;, new GenericCleanupDirActionDefinitionParser());
    }
}</pre>

      <p>
        We tell Spring to pass our top-level action element to our own
        parser implementation. The code for our custom BeanDefinitionParser is
        even simpler:
      </p>

      <pre class="prettyprint linenums">public class GenericCleanupDirActionDefinitionParser extends AbstractSimpleBeanDefinitionParser {

    @Override
    protected Class getBeanClass(Element element) {
        return GenericCleanupDirAction.class;
    }
}</pre>

      <p>
        We select the most simple form by choosing to extend
        AbstractSimpleBeanDefinitionParser, only providing the bean class
        which shall be generated - the mapping (and injection) of XSD
        attributes to properties is performed by Spring in this case. Of
        course parsing can be extended for more complex (nested) elements,
        just ase a AbstractSingleBeanDefinitionParser instead and overwrite
        the doParse() method.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Now that all our coding is done, one final step has to be
        performed. We have to make Spring XML parsing infrastructure aware our
        new schema. To achieve this, we have to register our XSD file and the
        namespace handler in two special purpose properties files which have
        to reside in the META-INF directory of your testing jar file. Spring
        will detect these and automatically pick them up as extension. At
        first, we declare our handler inside META-INF/spring.handlers:
      </p>

      <pre>http\://www.citrusframework.org/schema/jza/custom/actions=com.consol.jza.citrus.tutorial.actions.xml.CustomActionsNamespaceHandler</pre>

      <p>
        The left side is our own namespace (with escaped ':') which gets
        assigned the package path to our custom handler implementation on the
        right. Having our handler registered, we notify Spring about the
        existence of our custom schema by adding META-INF/spring.schemas with
        the following content:
      </p>

      <pre>http\://www.citrusframework.org/schema/jza/custom/actions/custom-actions.xsd=com/consol/jza/citrus/tutorial/schema/custom-actions.xsd</pre>

      <p>
        This entry defines a mapping of XML schema locations (which we
        will define right in a moment when using our new action namespace in
        our citrus tests) to the physical location of our custom XSD on the
        classpath.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        So now everything is in place: we have coded our own namespace
        handler and bean parser, defined our custom action schema and
        namespace and registered all of it to Spring's XML extensible
        authoring mechanism. Time to bring the harvest in and use our custom
        action in citrus tests as desired:
      </p>

      <pre class="prettyprint linenums">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;spring:beans xmlns=&quot;http://www.citrusframework.org/schema/testcase&quot;

  &lt;testcase name=&quot;SampleTest&quot;&gt;
    &lt;meta-info&gt;
      &lt;!-- ommitted --&gt;
    &lt;/meta-info&gt;

    &lt;actions&gt;
      &lt;echo&gt;
        &lt;message&gt;Even more attention! Calling my first custom XML action!&lt;/message&gt;
      &lt;/echo&gt;
      &lt;my:cleanupFileDirAction id=&quot;cleanLogsDir&quot; directory=&quot;/Users/jza/tmp/logs&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;my:cleanupFileDirAction id=&quot;cleanEtlDir&quot; directory=&quot;/Users/jza/tmp/etl&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/actions&gt;
  &lt;/testcase&gt;
&lt;/spring:beans&gt;</pre>

      <p>
        Note the declaration of our new namespace as 'my' and don't
        forget to declare the mapping to the schemalocation as well. It will
        save you lots of curses and hours of debugging Spring - I'm speaking
        from experience here. ;)
      </p>
      
      <p>
        That's it for the custom actions tutorial. We looked at two ways to
        create custom citrus actions inside your test projects. Using the
        generic citrus <i>action</i> element is a very easy and quick way to
        add your custom coded actions to a test project. Using the XML
        extensible authoring mechanism provides you with full control and
        improved reusability through parameterization in XML. Whichever
        approach you choose, we hope you enjoy extending citrus with custom
        actions as we do.
