  <title>Containers</title>

  <para>Similar to templates a container element holds one to many test actions. In contrast to the
  template the container appears directly inside the test case action chain, meaning that the container 
  is not referenced by more than one test case.</para>
  
  <para>Containers execute the embedded test actions in specific logic. This can be an execution in iteration
  for instance. Combine different containers with each other and you will be able to generate very powerful hierarchical
  structures in order to create a complex execution logic. In the following sections some predefined
  containers are described.</para>
