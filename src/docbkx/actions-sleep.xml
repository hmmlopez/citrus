    <title>Sleep</title>

    <para>This action shows how to make the test framework sleep for a given amount of time. The attribute 'time' defines 
    the amount of time to wait in seconds. As shown in the next example decimal values are supported too. When no waiting time is
    specified the default time of 50000 milliseconds applies.</para>

    <para>When should somebody use this action? To us this action was always very useful in case the test needed to wait until 
    an application had done some work. For example in some cases the application took some time to write some data into the database.
    We waited then a small amount of time in order to avoid unnecessary test failures, because the test framework simply validated 
    the database too early. Or as another example the test may wait a given time until retry mechanisms are triggered in the tested
    application and then proceed with the test actions.</para>
